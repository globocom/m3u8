# Contribution Guidelines

:tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

To contribute with the Megadraft you can just [fork the project](https://github.com/globocom/megadraft/fork_select), implement all the changes you need and then send us a pull request. 

It's important to make consistents pull request's. This means that every new feature should be in a separated pull request, in order to give us the possibility to review them separately (comments and feedback as well).

**All contribution is welcome, but we will merge a pull request if, and only if, it**
-  has tests
-  follows the code conventions

If you plan to implement a new feature or something that will take more than a few minutes, please open an issue to make sure we don't work on the same thing.
